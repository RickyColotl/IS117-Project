                                    Colotl Construction LLC was born out of a dream, hard work, and an unwavering commitment to 
                                    quality. Our founder, Gregory Colotl, began his journey in the construction industry over 
                                    20 years ago. His initial role was seemingly modest, responsible for maintaining clean and 
                                    organized work sites. But even in this capacity, Gregory demonstrated an exceptional work ethic 
                                    and a keen eye for detail.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Over the years, he advanced through the ranks, gaining invaluable hands-on experience in various 
                                    facets of construction. His dedication and talent did not go unnoticed, and he swiftly moved up from 
                                    basic tasks to more complex construction responsibilities. This period was instrumental in shaping his 
                                    understanding of the industry, from foundational work to intricate finishing details.<br><br>
                                    
                                    In 2009, Gregory Colotl took a significant leap, channeling his years of experience and passion 
                                    into founding Colotl Construction LLC. The company was built on the principles of integrity, quality, 
                                    and customer satisfaction. Under his leadership, Colotl Construction has grown into a reputable and 
                                    trusted name in the construction industry.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Today, Colotl Construction stands as a testament to the power of hard work and perseverance. We 
                                    specialize in a range of services, including new home construction, renovations, and commercial projects. 
                                    Our team, carefully selected and trained, mirrors the founder's commitment to excellence. We take pride 
                                    in our ability to transform visions into reality, ensuring each project reflects our high standards of 
                                    craftsmanship and attention to detail.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Our journey continues, driven by our dedication to building not just structures, but strong, lasting 
                                    relationships with our clients. We look forward to bringing more dreams to life and furthering our
